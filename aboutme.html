<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>Jeffrey Fernandez</h2>
<p>Born in New York and raised in the Dominican Republic, land of merengue and tropical climate. I am the third between my siblings. I have two brothers and one sister. I'm 21 years old and just started studying at BMCC. Moving from Dominican Republic was one of the best decisions I ever made because after the past year my life changed in a completely positive way. 
I live with my grandmother (on my momâ€™s side) in Washington Heights around the Columbia University Medical Center Campus. I used to have a very busy life because of family, friends and also working full time. Before the year was ended I decided to plan a long trip to Asia, and to do this I had to quit my job and get into my school so when I came back I had my life organized. The timing was perfect because by the time I returned, I would have become an New York State Resident and I would have to pay less money than a International Student. I decided to focus on my school, and getting a degree to have a better job and education. In my free time I enjoy shopping and hanging out with my friends in local places as much as just staying at home relaxing, watching music videos and movies or just eating all the food my grandmother cooks. I couldn't forget mentioning the delicious mangu with salami that she does for breakfast. What I love the most about my life in New York City is that there's always something happening.
